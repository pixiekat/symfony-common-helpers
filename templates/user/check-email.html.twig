  <p>
    If an account matching your email exists, then an email was just sent that contains a link that you can use to reset your password.
      This link will expire in {{ resetToken.expirationMessageKey|trans(resetToken.expirationMessageData, 'ResetPasswordBundle') }}.
  </p>
  <p>If you don't receive an email please check your spam folder or <a href="{{ path('pixiekat_symfony_helpers_password_reset') }}">try again</a>. If you'd just like to try logging in normally, you can login <a href="{{ path('pixiekat_symfony_helpers_login') }}">here</a>.</p>
